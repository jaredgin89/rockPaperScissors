The Odin Project
Rock Paper Scissors

This project is meant to show knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript by creating a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. 
The player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors and the computer is assigned randomly to one of these choices.
The game plays until one player reaches five. The game will reset after this score is reached.
